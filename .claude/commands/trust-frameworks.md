# Trust Signal: Frameworks
**E-E-A-T Category: EXPERTISE**

Create proprietary methodologies and frameworks that demonstrate deep expertise.

## PURPOSE
Frameworks are your strongest EXPERTISE signal. They show you've systematized knowledge into teachable, repeatable methods. Named frameworks become associated with YOU.

## INPUT
Requires (auto-loaded):
- Brand Profile (existing methodology)
- Competitor Analysis (gaps to fill)
- Voice Meta (naming style)

## FRAMEWORK TYPES

### 1. ACRONYM FRAMEWORK
Pattern: Each letter = step or principle
Examples: S.M.A.R.T. goals, AIDA, SWOT
Best for: Memorable, shareable, fits in social posts

### 2. NUMBERED SYSTEM
Pattern: X steps, pillars, or principles
Examples: 7 Habits, 4-Hour Workweek, 12 Rules
Best for: Comprehensive guides, courses

### 3. MATRIX/QUADRANT
Pattern: 2x2 grid categorization
Examples: Eisenhower Matrix, BCG Matrix
Best for: Decision-making, categorization

### 4. LADDER/PYRAMID
Pattern: Hierarchical levels
Examples: Maslow's Hierarchy, Content Pyramid
Best for: Progression, skill levels

### 5. CYCLE/WHEEL
Pattern: Iterative process
Examples: PDCA, Customer Lifecycle
Best for: Ongoing processes, feedback loops

### 6. EQUATION/FORMULA
Pattern: A + B = C
Examples: E=mc², Value = Benefits - Cost
Best for: Simple concepts, viral sharing

## GENERATION PROCESS

### Step 1: Identify Opportunity
From competitor gaps:
- What methodology is missing?
- Where do competitors lack structure?
- What concept needs simplification?

### Step 2: Extract Your Method
From Brand Profile:
- Your existing methodology steps
- Your unique approach
- Your differentiators

### Step 3: Structure & Name
Choose framework type that fits:
- Simple concept → Equation/Acronym
- Multi-step process → Numbered/Cycle
- Categorization → Matrix
- Progression → Ladder

Name criteria:
- Memorable (ideally 1-3 words)
- Unique (not already used)
- Meaningful (hints at benefit)
- Your-able (can be "The [Your Name] Method")

## OUTPUT

```
## FRAMEWORK: [NAME]

**Type:** [Acronym/Numbered/Matrix/etc.]
**Gap It Fills:** [From competitor analysis]
**Why Needed:** [Problem it solves]
