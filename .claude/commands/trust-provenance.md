# Trust Signal: Provenance
**E-E-A-T Category: TRUSTWORTHINESS**

Show methodology transparency - HOW you create content, develop expertise, and arrive at conclusions.

## PURPOSE
Provenance content is a TRUST signal that differentiates you from AI-generated content and surface-level creators. It shows your intellectual lineage, research rigor, and authentic process.

## WHY PROVENANCE MATTERS NOW

In an AI-saturated content landscape:
- Generic content is everywhere
- Audiences crave authenticity
- "Show your work" builds credibility
- Process reveals expertise
- Origin stories create connection

## INPUT
Requires (auto-loaded):
- Brand Profile (methodology, influences)
- Voice Meta (authentic voice patterns)

## PROVENANCE TYPES

### 1. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
Pattern: "How I research X"
Shows: Intellectual rigor
Trust Impact: High (proves depth)

### 2. ORIGIN STORY
Pattern: "How I developed X framework/approach"
Shows: Authentic development journey
Trust Impact: Very High (personal + professional)

### 3. INFLUENCES & SOURCES
Pattern: "Who/what shaped my thinking"
