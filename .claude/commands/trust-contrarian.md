Risk: Medium (can be proven wrong)
Engagement: High (future-focused)

### 6. SACRED COW
Pattern: "We need to stop worshipping X"
Risk: Very High
Engagement: Maximum (attacks beloved beliefs)

## SAFETY GUIDELINES

**Before publishing, check:**
1. Can you defend this with evidence?
2. Does it align with your values?
3. Are you attacking ideas, not people?
4. Would you say this to the person's face?
5. Is this your genuine belief or just for engagement?

**Avoid:**
- Personal attacks
- Positions you can't defend
- Hot takes you don't actually believe
- Controversy for controversy's sake

## GENERATION PROCESS

### Step 1: Identify Opportunities
From competitor gaps:
- What do ALL competitors agree on?
- What's the industry "common sense"?
- Where is the echo chamber?

From your experience:
- What have you learned that contradicts common advice?
- What works for you that "shouldn't"?
- What beliefs have you changed?

### Step 2: Test Strength
For each potential take:
- Can you provide evidence?
- Is there nuance to acknowledge?
- Does it serve your audience?

### Step 3: Craft Position
Structure:
- State the consensus clearly
- Present your counter-position
- Provide evidence/reasoning
- Acknowledge nuance
- Give actionable alternative
