# Layer 1: Structural DNA

How they build sentences, paragraphs, and use punctuation.

## Analysis Points

### 1. Sentence Length Patterns
- **Short:** 5-10 words
- **Medium:** 10-20 words
- **Long:** 20+ words
- **Variety score:** Mix vs consistent

Example output: "Short punchy sentences. One idea per line. Never rambling."

### 2. Paragraph Structure
- Paragraph length preference (1-liner vs chunky blocks)
- Opening sentence patterns (question, statement, transition)
- Closing sentence patterns (CTA, cliffhanger, summary)

### 3. Punctuation Signature
Analyze frequency of:
- Long dashes (the long horizontal line between words, like this)
- Ellipses (...)
- Question marks
- Parenthetical asides (like this)
- *Italics* for emphasis
- **Bold** for impact
- Exclamation points!
- Semicolons; colons:

### 4. List/Format Preferences
- Numbered lists vs bullet points vs no lists
- Headers/subheaders style
- White space usage
- Indentation patterns

## Example Output

```
LAYER 1: STRUCTURAL DNA

Sentence length: Short, punchy (avg 8-12 words)
Paragraphs: 1-3 sentences max, heavy white space
Punctuation: Frequent long dashes, occasional ellipses for pause
Lists: Bullet points preferred, never numbered
Formatting: Bold for key points, italics rare
```

## Analysis Prompt

When analyzing samples, look for:
1. Count average sentence length across multiple pieces
2. Note paragraph breaks, where do they typically break?
3. Track punctuation frequency, what's overused vs avoided?
4. Identify formatting consistency
