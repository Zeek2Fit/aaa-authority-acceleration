# Layer 4: Narrative DNA

How they tell stories and deliver lessons.

## Analysis Points

### 1. Story Type Preference
What kind of stories they tell:
- **Personal anecdotes** (happened to me)
- **Historical examples** (happened in history)
- **Hypothetical scenarios** (imagine if...)
- **Parables/metaphors** (it's like when...)
- **No stories** (pure instruction)

Calculate percentage: "70% personal, 20% hypothetical, 10% historical"

### 2. Story Structure
How stories are built:
- Start with hook vs context
- Linear timeline vs flashbacks
- Detailed scene-setting vs quick setup
- Dialogue inclusion (quoted conversations)
- Length of stories (brief mention vs extended)

### 3. Metaphor/Analogy Patterns
Types of comparisons used:
- **Sports analogies** - games, competition
- **Business/war metaphors** - battle, strategy
- **Food/cooking comparisons** - recipes, ingredients
- **Pop culture references** - movies, TV, music
- **Nature imagery** - growth, seasons
- **Tech/science analogies** - systems, engineering

**Note which types are AVOIDED**

### 4. Lesson Delivery
How the point is made:
- **Explicit moral:** "The lesson here is..."
- **Implicit:** Reader infers
- **Question-driven:** "So what does this mean?"
- **Direct application:** "Here's how you use this:"

## Example Output

```
LAYER 4: NARRATIVE DNA
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Story preference: 70% personal anecdotes, 20% hypothetical, 10% historical
Structure: Hook first, then quick context, minimal scene-setting
No dialogue unless critical to point
Metaphors: Business + sports analogies, NEVER food/cooking
Lesson delivery: Explicit, direct application, no abstract philosophizing
```

## Analysis Prompt

When analyzing samples, look for:
1. What kind of stories dominate?
2. How do they structure narratives?
3. What types of comparisons do they make?
4. How do they deliver the "so what"?
