# Topic Generation Formulas

## Source 1: Themes × Formats (40+ topics)
For each theme, apply 5-8 formats most relevant to content strategy.

**Example:**
- Theme: "Sustainable nutrition"
- Format: Contrarian
- Topic: "Calorie counting is sabotaging your results. Here's what actually works."

## Source 2: Methodology × Awareness Levels (15-21 topics)
For each methodology step, create topics for 3-5 awareness levels.

**Example:**
- Method Step: "Identity-first approach"
- Awareness: Problem Aware
- Topic: "Why diets fail but identity change lasts: The science of sustainable transformation"

## Source 3: Problem Landscape × ERISE (25-35 topics)
- Failed solutions → Educate/Contrarian
- Limiting beliefs → Inspire/Relate
- Top fear → Relate/Educate
- Priority needs → Educate/Actionable

**Example:**
- Failed Solution: "Extreme diets"
- Bucket: Contrarian
- Topic: "I tried every extreme diet for 10 years. Here's why they all failed."

## Source 4: Transformation Journey × Story Arcs (15-20 topics)
For each milestone, create story-based content.

**Example:**
- Milestone: "First habit that sticks"
- Format: Motivational
- Topic: "The moment you realize discipline beats motivation: A transformation story"

## Source 5: Contrarian Angles (10-15 topics)
Based on what they're AGAINST (their "old method").

**Example:**
- Against: "Hustle culture"
- Topic: "Hustle culture will burn you out. Here's the sustainable alternative."
