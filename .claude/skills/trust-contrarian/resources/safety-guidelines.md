# Safety Guidelines

## Before Publishing, Check:
1. Can you defend this with evidence?
2. Does it align with your values?
3. Are you attacking ideas, not people?
4. Would you say this to the person's face?
5. Is this your genuine belief or just for engagement?

## Avoid:
- Personal attacks
- Positions you can't defend
- Hot takes you don't actually believe
- Controversy for controversy's sake
